# Caesar Cipher - Command Line Encryption & Decryption

A simple command-line Python program that performs **encryption** and **decryption** using the **Caesar Cipher** technique.

##  What is Caesar Cipher?

The **Caesar Cipher** is a basic encryption method that replaces each letter in the plaintext with a letter a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. It's one of the simplest and oldest known encryption techniques.

## Features

- User-friendly command-line interface
- Choose between encryption or decryption
- Specify the shift key
- Works with both uppercase and lowercase letters
- Keeps non-alphabet characters (e.g., punctuation, numbers) unchanged
## Learning Outcomes

By exploring this project, we will:

- Understand the fundamentals of the Caesar Cipher encryption algorithm
- Learn how to manipulate characters using ASCII/Unicode values
- Practice handling user input and basic input validation in Python
- Gain experience in building simple command-line interfaces
- Understand modular programming concepts by separating logic into functions
- Recognize the limitations of simple substitution ciphers in modern cryptography
